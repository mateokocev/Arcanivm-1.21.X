ACRANIVM
=============================================================================


Acranivm is a planned Minecraft mod started in the version 1.21.1.

It features customizable magic weapons, armors and trinkets that provide both active and passive spells obtained through 
rituals. Rituals are planned to be multi-step processes that require both knowledge seeking and exploration to gather the necessary
ingredients to perform a successful ritual.

PLANNED FEATURES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Customizable weapons that are engraved by powerful spells.
- Armor sets that provide general and specific resistances depending on player choice.
- Trinkets that provide powerful buffs to players. The trinkets can be modified.
- Items will be crafted mostly through custom processes known as rituals.
- Dungeons with new mobs and bosses.
- Custom pets used for combat (constructs and summoned creatures, still thinking if automation through mobs should be a possibility).
- Spells that can be turned into custom enchants for existing MC items.
